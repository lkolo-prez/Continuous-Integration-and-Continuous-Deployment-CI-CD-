# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This repository serves as my knowledge base for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices. It contains various resources, examples, and configurations based on my experiences with implementing CI/CD pipelines using different tools and technologies. Here, you will find helpful information, best practices, and examples to aid in understanding and implementing CI/CD workflows.

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD is a set of practices and principles that enable development teams to deliver software more efficiently, consistently, and reliably. It involves automating the processes of building, testing, and deploying software, allowing for faster iterations and feedback loops.

**Continuous Integration (CI)** focuses on the automation of code integration and verification. It involves merging code changes frequently into a shared repository and running automated tests to ensure that the changes do not introduce issues or conflicts.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** builds upon CI and extends it to automate the deployment of validated changes to production or staging environments. It includes steps such as environment provisioning, configuration management, and release orchestration.

By adopting CI/CD practices, development teams can achieve benefits such as shorter development cycles, increased collaboration, reduced manual errors, and faster time-to-market.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of CI/CD workflows and tools commonly used in the industry:

1. **GitHub Actions**:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          # Execute build and test commands here

      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          # Execute deployment commands here
```

2. **GitLab CI/CD**:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - # Execute build commands here

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - # Execute test commands here

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - # Execute deployment commands here
```

3. **Jenkins Pipeline**:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        // Execute build commands here
      }
    }

    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        // Execute test commands here
      }
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        // Execute deployment commands here
      }
    }
  }
}
```
